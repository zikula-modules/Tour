<h1>First Time Tour</h1>
<p>The following pages give a quick overview of Zikula, designed to help a first time user get started with the software.  We'll explain the basic terms and concepts you need to be aware of, and how to get your site up and running.  Once you're finished here, you can check out the first time config section, where we'll guide you through setting the basics.  After that, you can start  reexperimenting, or alternatively start reading the documentation or the Wiki to learn more about Zikula.</p>

<h2>What is Zikula?</h2>
<p>Zikula is a Web Applications Framework written in PHP.  That's a technical way of saying that Zikula runs websites for you.  Extra functionality provided through modules and look and feel changes provided through themes allow you to quickly change and expand your website.  Zikula can morph into precisely what you need, whether that be an ultra flexible content management system or simple personal blog.</p>

<p>You've already got some of the way to experiencing the power of Zikula by choosing a distribution.  Use the link at the top of the page to learn more about your distribution.  There are a number of distributions available, designed to fit a range of needs.  The distribution you download will be designed for a specific scenario, and should help you get started, however at any time you can add more features to your site by downloading modules from the extensions database.</p>
